     * - Split the signature into two parts delimited by the '.' character.
     * - Decode the first part (the encoded signature) with base64url encoding.
     * - Decode the second part (the response payload) with base64url encoding, which should be a string representation of a JSON object that has the following fields: ** algorithm - always equals to HMAC-SHA256 ** issued_at - a unix timestamp of when this response was issued. ** asid - the app-scoped user id of the player.
     * - Hash the whole response payload string using HMAC SHA-256 and your app secret and confirm that it is equal to the encoded signature.
     * - You may also wish to validate the issued_at timestamp in the response payload to ensure the request was made recently.
     *
     * Signature validation should only happen on your server. Never do it on the client side as it will compromise your app secret key.
